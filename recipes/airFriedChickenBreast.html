  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    An easy air fryer chicken breast recipe for one that can be scaled up for more people.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instruction</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Brush both sides of chicken breast with olive oil; season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper on one side.
      Place chicken breast, seasoned-side down, into the air fryer basket and sprinkle the other side with garlic
      powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 9 minutes. Flip chicken and continue cooking until no longer pink in the
      center and the juices run clear, about 9 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
      read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken breast to a plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
